# MyToken

MyToken is a simple token contract written in Solidity. 
It is designed to demonstrate the basic functionalities of a token contract, such as minting and burning tokens.

# Getting Started


To use MyToken, you will need to have access to a Solidity compiler, such as Remix or Truffle.
You can also deploy the contract to a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, using a tool like MetaMask.

# Prerequisites
Solidity compiler
Remix or Truffle IDE (optional)
MetaMask (optional)

# Deployment
To deploy MyToken, follow these steps:

Open the Solidity compiler of your choice.

Copy and paste the code from MyToken.sol into the compiler.

Compile the code.

Deploy the contract to a blockchain network of your choice.

# Usage
Once the contract is deployed, you can use it to mint and burn tokens. To mint new tokens, call the mint function with an address and a value. To burn tokens, call the burn function with an address and a value.
